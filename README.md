# artProjects

AIM: Modify programs using parameters and class constants to create original artworks.(0)  Use strings to create art (1)
Assessment: Complete an art project and “artist statement” justifying their programming choices


Students create a design that uses parameters, loops, and/or nested loops. Extra points will be awarded for particularly complex/creative images.

Students use (and keep copies of) a structure diagram and/or pseudocode for their own records, since they will be expected to write a short paragraph explaining their program in plain English.
